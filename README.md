How to play?
The jet follows the mouse and rotates to face the direction the mouse is pointing to. Clicking the left mouse button fires the shot. There are three different types of missiles that are trying to destroy your plane. The red missile is worth 10 points if it is shot down. The purple missile is worth 15 points and the blue missile is worth 20 points. However the speed of the missiles are proportional to the points they are worth. Evading missiles also socres you points. You obtain one point per every second you are not destroyed. If a missile hits you, it is game over. Also these missiles are homing missiles.
